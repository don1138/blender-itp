![Blender ITP](https://github.com/don1138/blender-itp/blob/main/imx/blender-itp.jpg)

## Installation

Download the latest ZIP from **Releases**, or `node_image_texture_properties.py` from repository, and install addon.

## Usage

This addon creates a panel named **Image Texture Properties** under ``Shader Editor > Sidebar > Node``.

Select one or more Image Textures and the panel looks like this:

If `projection` is set to `BOX`, a Blend Value field appears:

If no Image Texture is selected, the panel shows an empty state:

## Backstory

I was working on a PBR with six image textures, and had to change the `Projection` to `BOX` six times. *(Because it had slipped my mind that I could simply hold the Control key to copy changes across all selected nodes. ðŸ¤”)*

The existing `Properties` panel will set things like `Color Mode` for all selected images, but doesn't include the full set of properties listed on the node itself.

Deciding that such tyranny will not stand on my watch, I made a quick extension to allow me to set the outstanding properties of all selected `Image Textures` with one click.

Because that's what heroes do. *(Instead of simply holding the Control key to copy changes across all selected nodes. ðŸ™„)*
